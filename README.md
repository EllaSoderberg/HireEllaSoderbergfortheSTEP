# Simple job application website
My website to apply for the STEP 2017.

## Installation
Download this project to your computer. Open the file with your browser (preferably Chrome, doesn't work well with IE) + open it in a text-editor. 

## Usage

This is for anyone curious who wants to understand what you can make from just a single document of code. It's also an example of what you can use W3.CSS lib for. 

## Contributing

Feel free to fork my repo, branch it, make some changes and improvements push these to me if you want me to give you feedback or want to help me get better! Could I have made it even more simple for example? 

This is how you do it via the command line:  
1. Fork it!  
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`  
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`  
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`  
5. Submit a pull request :D

## History

This is the first website I've created from scratch and I'm using it to apply for google's STEP in London 2017. I learned HTML and CSS at an internship a year ago but I've never created anything for myself until now.  

**This is how I learned to code** - I started off at [codeacademy](https://www.codeacademy.com) trying out whatever sounded cool, later I got the amazing opportunity to do an internship at Ericsson. We where thrown into this big project and I went from knowing very basic HTML and JavaScript to understanding git, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, libraries, frameworks, how less is more really applies to coding etc.

But _the most important part of that experience - for which you do not need an internship_ was how I was forced to try and solve programming problems for eight hours a day for four months. **Consistancy is the key and if you see programming as an interest like photography or painting which I do - learning it won't be a problem!**
